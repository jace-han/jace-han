## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Jace Han** and my life is like a squiggle â¤´â¤µâ¤´â¤µ

During my Bachelor's Degree in Life Sciences, I stumbled upon the AI space and still exploring to this day. 

If we share the same interest in **AI and Data Science**, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jace-han/), I would love to hear about what you are working on! I'm hoping to work on some side projects to curate my portfolio and make open source contributions to projects I align with.

This repository will keep track of my progress, stay tuned! âœ¨âœ¨
